# React Challenge

I want to create code challenges to test my understanding of React lifecycle methods.

So I can understand the useState, useEffect, and useContext.

For useEffect create 3 code challenge so I can understand when the effect runs:

```
[] → Run once on mount
[value1, value2] → Run on mount and when any dependency changes
No dependency array → Run on every render
```

That means there are 5 code challenges
- useState
- useEffect [] → Run once on mount
- useEffect [value1, value2] → Run on mount and when any dependency changes
- useEffect No dependency array → Run on every render
- useContext

- Please create the unit tests as well to make sure the expected behavior is met for my codes.
- Please create the answers of the challanges in a separate folder called `answers`.

My job is to fix the code in code challenges using useState, useEffect, and useContext. I can run the unit test to make sure the expected behavior is met for the codes.
